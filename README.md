# Test for Echo
Named in honor of Rush's excellent record of the same title, this is a little echo server I use to test some of my microservice applications in isolation.  It doesn't do much right now, it just echos back what you send it. 
* It color codes the HTTP method so you can easily spot what's going on
* It runs on multiple ports, which right now are hardcoded to meet my needs.

I have lots of ideas to make this more useful!
